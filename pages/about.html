                <h1>About Opera Gallery</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Opera Gallery adventure began almost 30 years ago, in 1994, when our two first exhibition spaces opened simultaneously in Paris and in Singapore with the aim of showing international emerging artists alongside masters of Contemporary and Modern Art. Thanks to an incredible community of collectors, artists, supporters and my outstanding Opera Gallery staff, <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">we have, along the years, expanded to include<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>now sixteen locations around the world: in New York, Miami, Miami Bal Harbour, Aspen, London, Monaco, Geneva, Dubai, Beirut, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Madrid.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p>We present work across all media including painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, photography and video and we seek to cultivate the lineages that run between emerging and established artists. We represent over twenty international young and emerging artists such as Andy Denzler, Fred Eerdekens or Anthony James and more established artists such as Manolo Valdés, Fernando Botero, Juan Genovés or André Brasilier. We also deal in private sales on the secondary market informed by decades of connoisseurship and we are proud to have placed historically significant works by artists such as Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Pierre Soulages, Alexander Calder, Jean Dubuffet, Fernando Botero and many more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since our inception, we have strived to offer museums, foundations and art collectors unique access to an incredible selection of Modern and Contemporary artists through an exciting programme of curated exhibitions in each of our locations and in high profile art fairs. In addition to the exhibitions, we are fully dedicated in working closely with our collectors to build their collections, locating works of art, and providing art advisory services. The gallery also facilitates museum exhibitions, special projects, and commissions of large-scale, site-specific sculptures for both public and private collections. We are fully dedicated to bringing with integrity and discretion only the best of Modern and Contemporary works to each of our collectors.</p>
