                <h1>About Opera Gallery</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Opera Gallery adventure began almost 30 years ago, in 1994, when our two first exhibition spaces
                    opened simultaneously in Paris and in Singapore with the aim of showing international emerging
                    artists alongside masters of Contemporary and Modern Art. Thanks to an incredible community of
                    collectors, artists, supporters and my outstanding Opera Gallery staff, <span lang="EN-US"
                        style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">we have, along the years, expanded to include<span
                            style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>now sixteen locations around the world: in New York,
                        Miami, Miami Bal Harbour, Aspen, London, Monaco, Geneva, Dubai, Beirut, Hong Kong, Seoul,
                        Singapore and Madrid.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p>We present work across all media including painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, photography
                    and video and we seek to cultivate the lineages that run between emerging and established artists.
                    We represent over twenty international young and emerging artists such as Andy Denzler, Fred
                    Eerdekens or Anthony James and more established artists such as Manolo Valdés, Fernando Botero, Juan
                    Genovés or André Brasilier. We also deal in private sales on the secondary market informed by
                    decades of connoisseurship and we are proud to have placed historically significant works by artists
                    such as Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Pierre Soulages, Alexander Calder, Jean Dubuffet, Fernando
                    Botero and many more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since our inception, we have strived to offer museums, foundations and art collectors unique access
                    to an incredible selection of Modern and Contemporary artists through an exciting programme of
                    curated exhibitions in each of our locations and in high profile art fairs. In addition to the
                    exhibitions, we are fully dedicated in working closely with our collectors to build their
                    collections, locating works of art, and providing art advisory services. The gallery also
                    facilitates museum exhibitions, special projects, and commissions of large-scale, site-specific
                    sculptures for both public and private collections. We are fully dedicated to bringing with
                    integrity and discretion only the best of Modern and Contemporary works to each of our collectors.
